//! Platform services
//!
//! A thin abstraction-layer over various platform services provided by individual
//! trusted execution environments and the Rust standard library (for
//! "freestanding-chihuahua").  These services are exposed by Chihuahua to the WASM
//! program running in the TEE through a H-call.
//!
//! Services provided by this library:
//! - A random number source taken from a platform-specific trusted source of entropy
//!   (if within a TEE).  Note for `std` targets the random source is assumed to be
//!   the random number generator of the host operating system.
