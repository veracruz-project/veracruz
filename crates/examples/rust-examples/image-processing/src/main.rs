//! A simple image processing example
//!
//! ## Context
//!
//! A relatively-low powered device (think e.g. an M-class microcontroller, or similar)
//! wants to offload some heavy, complex calculation to a third-party---image processing here.
//! The owner of the device wishes to ensure that the computation was faithfully executed---that is,
//! the results are trustworthy and are definitely the output of the image transform---and also are
//! kept secret from third parties wishing to see what is happening on the device.
//!
//! Inputs:                  1.
//! Assumed form of inputs:  A PNG image mapped to the virtual filesystem at runtime
//! Ensured form of outputs: A PNG image mapped saved to the virtual filesystem
//!
