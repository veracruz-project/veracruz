//! Types and definitions relating to the Veracruz global policy.
//!
//! The global policy captures important information about a Veracruz
//! computation that principals need to audit before they enroll themselves in a
//! computation.  This includes:
//!
//! - The identities and roles of every principals in the computation,
//! - Important URLs, both for the Veracruz bridge server on the untrusted
//!   host's machine and the Veracruz proxy attestation service,
//! - Permissible ciphersuites for TLS connections between clients and the
//!   trusted Veracruz runtime, as well as the hashes of the expected program
//!   and of the trusted Veracruz runtime itself,
//! - The expiry date (moment in time) of the self-signed certificate issued by
//!   the enclave during a pre-computation bootstrapping process,
//! - The execution strategy that will be used by the trusted Veracruz runtime
//!   to execute the WASM binary, as well as a debug configuration flag which
//!   allows the WASM binary to write data to `stdout` on the untrusted host's
//!   machine,
//! - The order in which data inputs provisioned into the enclave will be placed
//!   which is important for the program provider to understand in order to
//!   write software for Veracruz.
