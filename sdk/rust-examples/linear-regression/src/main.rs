//! A simple linear-regression example
//!
//! ## Context
//!
//! A relatively-low powered device (think e.g. an M-class microcontroller, or similar)
//! wants to offload some heavy, complex calculation to a third-party---here represented by a linear
//! regression problem.  The owner of the device wishes to ensure that the computation was
//! faithfully executed---that is, the results are trustworthy and are definitely the output of a
//! linear regression algorithm---and also are kept secret from third parties wishing to see what is
//! happening on the device.
//!
//! Inputs:                  1.
//! Assumed form of inputs:  one Pinecode-encoded `Vec<(f64, f64)>` representing a dataset of (x, y)
//!                          co-ordinates from which a linear relationship is to be extracted.
//! Ensured form of outputs: A Pinecode-encoded `LinearRegression` struct (see below) consisting of
//!                          a gradient and a Y-intercept, representing the best linear fit for the
//!                          input data.
