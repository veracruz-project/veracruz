Veracruz is now an adopted project of the [Confidential Compute Consortium (CCC)](https://confidentialcomputing.io).

Veracruz is a framework for defining and deploying collaborative, privacy-preserving computations amongst a group of mutually mistrusting individuals.
Some potential use-cases for Veracruz include:

* Privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning,
* Privacy-preserving delegated computations from a computationally weak device to a more capable (but potentially untrusted) edge device or server,
* Secret auctions, elections or polls, surveys,
* ...and many more.

Veracruz uses *strong isolation* technology (a mixture of *trusted hardware* and high-assurance *hypervisor-based* isolation), along with  *remote attestation protocols*, to establish a safe, "neutral ground" within which a collaborative computation takes place on an untrusted device.
Concretely, Veracruz computations are special-purpose *WebAssembly* binaries, compiled against a small SDK which we provide.
WebAssembly acts both as a sandbox, pinning down the behaviour of the program, and allows us to abstract over the different strong isolation technologies that we support.

To learn more about Veracruz, the motivation, design, use-cases, and so on, please read the [Veracruz project wiki](https://github.com/veracruz-project/veracruz/wiki) or dive in and start playing with Veracruz using [our Docker container](https://github.com/veracruz-project/veracruz-docker-image).
The latest project news is available on the [Veracruz project homepage](https://veracruz-project.github.io).
